I'm a computer handyman currently living in Kyoto, Japan. In the last few years I have worked in several Linux/UNIX system administration and automation roles.

I was born in France, but I have been living internationally for a few years now. I completed my BSc in Computer Science at the [University of Lyon](https://fst-informatique.univ-lyon1.fr/) and my MSc in Cybersecurity at the [University of Grenoble](https://master-informatique.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/), but half of my MSc classes were taught at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english) in Copenhagen.

In my spare time I love cycling and it is my favorite way of travelling. I believe [we don't need rock stars](https://hypatia.ca/2016/06/21/no-more-rock-stars/) in our organizations.
